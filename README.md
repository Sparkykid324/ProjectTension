Then in the Unity Hub, click the dropdown menu next to open, click add project from disk, find where you cloned the repository, find the folder ("Tension"), then you can open it from unity. You will not see any changes that have been made, you have to open the scene youd like to work in. If you would like to upload your changes (push), save the project, choose which branch to push into (if its a big experimental change make a new branch, if its a small change, push to main.) Alwayts pull any changes before you start doing any work.
